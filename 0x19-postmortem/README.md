Issue Summary

The server was down for approx. 7 hours starting from 2pm to 9pm Pacific Time.
Most user requests resulted in 503 errors at peak traffic.
After trying several server resets and configuring, we've found the root cause to be chewed wires by a family of roving raccoons at our physical server site.
Animal control was called and replacement wires were dispatched.

Timeline

2pm - Server goes down
3pm - Major server restart
4pm - Called in third-party help
5pm - Calls to physical server for maintenance
6pm - Animal Control called, replacement wires ordered
7pm - Wires arrived, replaced and got the servers up and running

Root Cause

At approx. 1:30pm Pacific Time, the custodian at our physical server site recalled seeing a family of roving raccoons. He reports that there were 2 large raccoons and 5-6 smaller raccoons.
However, believing that the fences were too high and secure for them to climb over, he did not think twice about reporting them.
Around 2pm, our west coast servers went down.
We checked to see if there were any internal errors on our side. All maintenance checkups came back positive.
We've looked at our logs to see if we had been attacked but there were no traces of a DDoS attack.
Security teams confirmed that there had been no breach.
5pm, we called our physical server site to see if there had been any damage to the equipment. That's when we found the chewed wires.

Resolution and Recovery

Once we realized the root cause, we set to determine the extent of the damage to replace the equipment and to get us up in working order ASAP.
When we had finally assessed the extent, we were able to quickly replace the wires and to have the physical site team to get our servers back up.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

There was serious oversight in checking to make sure that our physical server was undamaged. This was done way too late and in the future, we need to ensure that it does not happen again.
